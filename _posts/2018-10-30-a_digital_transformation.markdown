My road to code has been a circuitous one. Upon graduating from college, I expected that I would immediately attend law school. However, it was a peculiar time for the legal industry. The market was oversaturated with lawyers, and paths to partnerships at firms we’re becoming increasingly rare. Salaries had stagnated, and in many cases dropped. These realities gave me some pause, and I decided to go to work—even if I eventually decided to attend law school—just to build up some experience in the professional world and get a feel for what else may be out there.

I had always had an interest in technology—especially the intersection between business and technology—so I was fortunate to land a position as a recruiter for the enterprise data warehouse of a Fortune 500 company. The company was in the midst of a massive IT-insourcing initiative, and I got the opportunity to learn about, and interact with, various project managers, developers, data architects, and a few CTOs.

After a couple years, I moved on to a business development role at an IT research and consulting firm. There, I was able to engage with thought leaders across the technology spectrum, and one thing became abundantly clear; the world was in the midst of a digital transformation and software was at the heart of it.

Every company was becoming a software company whether they knew it or not. All the vital aspects of a company’s functionality were rooted in software scalability, agility, security, and interconnectivity.  I began doing some coding tutorials online during quiet moments at work. What started as a series of awkward concepts slowly became a framework for solving problems. It was exciting to observe my mind changing, and I experienced a primordial sense of satisfaction in building things and seeing them work. It was a feeling that I never quite felt in the sales/business development world.

All of the above has led me to this point. There have been many of twists and turns, and the path has not always been clear, but I am grateful to be on this path. I am eager to continue learning and bring to fruition my own digital transformation.
