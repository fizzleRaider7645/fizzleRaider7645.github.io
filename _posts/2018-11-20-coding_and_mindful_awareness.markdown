Learning is as much about welcoming change as it is about being disciplined. In fact, it seems clear to me now that learning necessarily requires an openness to change, and the waves of resistance that accompanies it. The way to ride these waves—rather than sinking into them—is to apply mindful awareness to your studies. This seems particularly true when it comes to programming.

I’ve never considered myself a very analytical person. My problem-solving skillsets were somewhat anemic when I began to study coding. I struggled with just about every concept I encountered, whether it be the distinction between class and instance methods, how classes interact, and what a block actually was. The concept of an enumerable even threw me for a loop when I first encountered it.

I succumbed to a lot of resistance in those earlier phases of learning code. Instead of deeply focusing on the task at hand, my mind would be jumping frantically from one negative thought to another. I did not know what to do with the unsettledness that I was feeling as I grappled with articles and online tutorials. I wanted to get to the bottom what was wrong, but then something happened; I managed to learn something. Indeed, concepts that used to seem utterly abstract began to take some shape in my mind and were becoming frameworks for thinking and solving problems I once couldn’t touch. I realized that the unsettledness I felt was not proof that something was wrong, but rather, it was proof that I was learning.

It was an empowering recognition, and I felt filled with gratitude, however the one thing I did regret was having ever fell prey to resistance. I thought of the time wasted and all the mental chatter that distracted from my goal of becoming a developer. From that moment forward I committed to apply mindful awareness to my studies. All this meant, in practice, was to acknowledge my feelings and drop the stories. Rather than sinking into thoughts like, “you’re not cut out for this,” I acknowledged that I’m feeling frustration, and then I let it go. This practice seemed to foster a clearer mindset that made learning new programming concepts easier. Moreover, I notice my relationship with resistance shift. Rather than being something I wanted to run away from, I recognized It as a precursor to the joy felt when I comprehended some new concept. 

Learning is very much about change, and change is scary, but practicing mindful awareness when studying has aided my progress coding, as well as helped me realize that resistance is just part of the process.
